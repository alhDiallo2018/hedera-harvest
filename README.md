## 🚀 Executive Summary

AgroSense bridges the gap between smallholder farmers and impact investors through blockchain-based tokenization of agricultural yields. Farmers issue tokens representing future crop output (e.g., 1 token = 1 kg of maize), while investors gain exposure to real-world agricultural assets with transparent, auditable returns.

**Built on Hedera** for ultra-low fees, fast finality, and enterprise-grade security.

**Target Impact:** 30-50% income uplift for farmers while creating scalable impact investment opportunities.
